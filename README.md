# PHP-code-that-you-can-use-to-convert-a-link-in-a-PDF-to-a-QR-code-and-embed-it-into-the-PDF
Here is the PHP code that you can use to convert a link in a PDF to a QR code and embed it into the PDF:


This code will first upload the PDF file to the server. Then, it will use the TCPDF library to create a new PDF document. Next, it will use the PHPQRCode library to generate a QR code for the link in the PDF. Finally, it will embed the QR code into the PDF document and output the PDF file to the browser.

To run this code, you will need to install the TCPDF and PHPQRCode libraries. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
composer require tcpdf/tcpdf
composer require phpqrcode/phpqrcode
```

Once you have installed the libraries, you can save the code above as a PHP file and run it on your web server.

# To run the code, 
you will need to save it as a PHP file and then run it on your web server. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Create a new PHP file and save it as `invoice_with_qrcode.php`.
2. Copy the code above into the PHP file.
3. Upload the PHP file to your web server.
4. Open the PHP file in a web browser.

The PHP file will then upload the PDF file, generate a QR code for the link in the PDF, and embed the QR code into the PDF document. The PDF file will then be output to the browser.

# Here are some additional things to keep in mind when running the code:

* The PDF file must be in the same directory as the PHP file.
* The link in the PDF file must be a valid URL.
* The size of the QR code can be adjusted by changing the `setSize()` method in the `QRCode` class.
* The margin around the QR code can be adjusted by changing the `setMargin()` method in the `QRCode` class.
